# How to compile

This project can be compiled under Visual Studio 2012 and GCC(with G++) 4.8.1 (or above)

In Linux, just clone this repository and type `make` in this directory.

The Makefile script is only tested in Ubuntu & Windows.

FIXME: I don't know how to `make install`. So if you know, please let me know.

In Windows with MinGW (gcc, g++, & make installed), just follow same step in Linux above.

In Windows with Visual Studio 2012 or above, just open `sln/HonokaMiku.sln` and compile.
